# hello-world
A regular repository

I am learning coding for fun and because it seems useful.
I love learning about languages and coding emulates real-life languages.
It's June 2020 and the future is uncertain.
I have my whole life ahead of me.
I want to spend it doing things I enjoy, so here I am.
